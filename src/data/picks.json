      "tagline": "Best Architectural Experience",
      "whyWeLoveIt": "Once the largest Islamic college in Morocco, this 14th-century masterpiece features stunning zellige tilework, carved stucco, and cedar wood carvings. The central courtyard with its reflecting pool is pure architectural poetry.",
      "imageKey": "benYoussef",
      "introduction": "'You who enter my door, may your highest hopes be exceeded' reads the inscription over the entryway to the magnificent Ben Youssef Medersa (adult/child under 12 Dh50/10), and after almost six centuries, the blessing still works its charms on visitors. This former Quranic school is Marrakesh's most important historic monument.",
      "details": "Courtyard\nStep from the street under a porch of muqarnas, decorative honeycomb-like plaster vaulting, and through massive doors covered in carved bronze. Then, emerging from the relative darkness of the entry hall through mashrabiya (latticed) doors, it's difficult to suppress a gasp of astonishment at the serene beauty of the courtyard with its sensational decoration. At 15m x 20m, the expanse is a relief after the tiny streets of the medina outside.\n\nA large pool is set in the marble floor, surrounded by channels that keep the water flowing. The water for this central pool and the hammam is kept moving by pipes at different levels. Don't miss the cutaway in the vestibule wall that shows how the ingenious ancient water system works. The CGI movie at Le Jardin Secret in Mouassine explains this ancient hydraulic system further.\n\nDecoration\nIn the courtyard, the walls and columns are covered in zellige (colourful geometric mosaic tilework), with friezes of calligraphy above, then intricate stucco carving – look out for the Saadian-era pine cones and palm trees carved into the plaster. All of this is topped by carved cedar wood. The muqarnas on the domed ceiling in the prayer room opposite the entrance are particularly beautiful, and the mihrab (niche denoting the direction of Mecca) has finely sculpted marble. The medersa underwent considerable rehabilitation and renovation from 2017 to 2023.\n\nStudents' Lodgings\nStudents came from all over North Africa to study the Quran, Islamic law, algebra, literature, history and science at this, the most important medersa in Morocco, and the largest in the region. With 130 rooms, the medersa accommodated up to 800 students in dorms arranged on different levels around the main courtyard and around six smaller courtyards open to the sky to provide light.\n\nThe ablution room on the ground floor has four marble columns and a domed ceiling over a central water basin and surrounding latrine rooms (today transformed into modern toilets for visitors).",
      "quickBreak": "The entrance courtyard of the adjacent Musée de Marrakech has a charming cafe with plenty of shady seating where you can rest up and enjoy a mint tea.",
      "planningTip": "The earlier you visit (it opens at 9am), the quieter the medersa will be. Large tour groups descend on it from mid-morning. Expect to spend about an hour here.",
